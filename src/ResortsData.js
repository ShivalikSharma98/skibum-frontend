			'One of the most popular, if not the most popular ski resort destination in Colorado. Spanning more than 3,000 acres across several distinct mountain areas, Snowmass is the largest, most diverse resort in the Aspen conglomerate.',

			"Four huge peaks, five terrain parks, three half-pipes, two high-speed six passenger lifts, the highest chairlift in North America, and unparalleled grooming. It'd be hard to beat Breckenridge if it weren't for the immense amount of traffic brought in every year from tourism, which is likely due to its close proximity to Denver, that allows tourists to find more affordable lodging options then those provided at the resorts.",

			'The trails below the tree line are classically Colorado - well designed fall line runs with rollers and compressions to keep it interesting, and long enough to scorch the quads of the most hardened ski aficionado. Above the tree line in the high alpine areas of Copper Ski Resort there are deep powder bowls, chutes, cornices, jumps and bumps. Snowboarders love the well designed terrain and layout at Copper Mountain Resort as it also bolsters one of the best terrain parks in the country, the official training center for Team USA',

			'The Winter Park Ski Resort has two main interconnected mountains that have separate base areas; Winter Park and Mary Jane. Winter Park is characterized with terrain for beginners, intermediates, and park shredders. The Mary Jane terrain is more difficult and is pigeon holed as lots of single black diamond mogul runs. Mary Jane also has trees where you might find a little powder stash and solace from the bumps.',

			'When one thinks about the legendary ski resorts around the world, a number immediately spring to mind. The Vail Ski Resort in Colorado is definitely one of those. Resorts don’t reach legendary status without good reason. Vail Colorado has it all - massive and varied terrain, a huge modern and efficient lift system, great vertical, tons of snow, and a vibrant village with all the services one would expect from a mega resort.',
